This is my data vizualisation portfolio.

I gathered code I wrote to create some nice plots, put them in an Rmarkdown to create an HTML page where I would have an easy and centralized access to all of those code lines. The goal is to preview the graphs so I can identify the features I want to re-use while creating a new plot, and to be able to copy and paste the chunks I want.

The .Rmd file can run by itself, all the data is either simulated or arbitrarily defined.

The HTML page is deployed [here](https://hugomrth.github.io/dataVizualisationPortfolio/) as a githug page.
